Demonstrate the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) Algorithm. This rep contains a Python program for reading the languages of context-free grammar (CFG) for context-free languages (CFL). Note that, the CFG of the given language must be converted to Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) before being read by the program.
